# GridPorter Project Plan

## Project Overview
GridPorter is a vision-enabled AI spreadsheet ingestion framework that uses Large Language Models with vision capabilities to automatically detect and extract multiple tables from Excel and CSV files. By understanding spreadsheets visually, it handles complex real-world layouts that traditional parsers fail on.
